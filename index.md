# Privacy Policy for HearNotify

**Last updated:** 11 January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how **HearNotify** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## Data Collection and Privacy
We prioritize your privacy. **HearNotify does not collect or transmit any user data off the device.** * **Local Processing:** Notifications captured by the app are only processed locally to play sounds and are not stored externally.
* **Sensitive Information:** Any sensitive information contained within your notifications is kept private on your device. It is not shared, sold, or used without your consent.

## Notification Handling
To function correctly, HearNotify must access your notifications.
* **Volatile Memory:** Notifications are temporarily held in memory (RAM) for processing and playback. 
* **No Permanent Storage:** They are not written to permanent storage, preventing other apps from scanning or accessing them.
* **Automatic Clearing:** If HearNotify is closed or the service is stopped, the notification log in memory is immediately cleared.

## Installed Apps Data
HearNotify reads the list of installed apps on your device.
* **Purpose:** This is strictly to allow you to configure "Per-App" settings (e.g., enabling sound for WhatsApp but not for Email).
* **Local Storage:** App titles, package names, and logo images are stored locally on your device to improve performance and configuration speed. This list is never uploaded to any server.

## Permissions
The app requires specific permissions to function:

1.  **Notification Access:** Required to read incoming notifications so HearNotify can play sounds. You must explicitly grant this permission in your device settings.
2.  **Query All Packages:** Required to generate the list of installed apps so you can apply specific configurations to them.

## Third-Party Apps and Services
While HearNotify itself does not track you, it relies on system components that have their own policies:

### Text-To-Speech (TTS) Engine
Notification text is passed to your device's default TTS engine to be read aloud. 
* The TTS engine is outside the control of HearNotify.
* Please refer to the privacy policy of your specific TTS provider (e.g., Google, Samsung) regarding how they process text.

### Google Play Services
The app may use Google Play Services.
* This service may send anonymized data for analytics, crash reports, or app performance improvements (e.g., ANR reports).

## Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
